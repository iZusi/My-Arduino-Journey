# My Arduino Journey
Welcome to my Arduino journey repository! Here, I document my exciting exploration of electronics and programming using Arduino, starting from the foundational stage of blinking a simple LED and progressing towards robotics projects.

## About Me
I'm a passionate learner eager to examine the world of Arduino and electronics. This repository serves as my digital portfolio, showcasing my progress, skills, and the projects I've undertaken along the way.

## Project Highlights
Explore my Arduino journey through the following projects:
1. [Project 1 - LED Blinking Wave](Projects/P1/README.md): My first step into Arduino, where I learned the basics by making a blinking wave of LEDs.
2. [Project 2 - Digital Input](Projects/P2/README.md): Exploring interaction and responsiveness through digital input with Arduino.
3. [Project 3 - Single-cell Battery Tester](Projects/P3/README.md): Creating a single-cell battery tester to measure voltage capacities of AA batteries.
4. [Project 4a - Quick-Read Thermometer](Projects/P4a/README.md): A simple quick-read thermometer to test different temperature ranges.
5. [Project 4b - Enhanced Quick-Read Thermometer](Projects/P4b/README.md): The enhanced version of the quick-read thermometer with a 7-segment LED for visual display.
6. [Project 5 - Controlling Traffic with Two 7-Segment LEDs](Projects/P5/README.md): A simulation of a real-world traffic control system
7. [Project 6 - Weather Station](Projects/P6/README.md): A weather station to check real-time temperature and humidity readings using Arduino and DHT11 sensor, displayed on an LCD screen

## Acknowledgment
Most of my projects are inspired by or directly from:
  - ["Arduino Workshop: A Hands-On Introduction with 65 Projects" by John Boxall](https://nostarch.com/arduino-workshop-2nd-edition)
  - ["Arduino Project Handbook: 25 Practical Projects to Get You Started" by Mark Geddes](https://nostarch.com/arduinohandbook)

I greatly appreciate the valuable guidance and knowledge provided by these resources.

## Goals
I aspire to progress further into the world of electronics, robotics, and IoT. My goals include:
- Building robotic projects and enhancing my programming skills.
- Contributing to open-source Arduino projects and the maker community.
